# Informations
Here you can find some useful Python exercises I used during a Data Science course. Work in progress...

# EX1
The relationship between the sides (a, b) of a triangle and the hypotenuse (h) is given by the formula: 𝑎^2+𝑏^2=ℎ^2. Write a program that reads the length of the sides and calculates the hypotenuse.
Notes:
- The square root can be calculated with the function sqrt(), defined in "math" library.
- To read a keyboard input you can use the raw_input() function that waits a keyboard input and returns it after ENTER is pressed;

# EX2
Write a program to convert a given measurement in feet to its equivalents in:
a) yards
b) inches
c) centimetres
d) metres 
Read the number of feet and print the number of yards, inches, centimeters and meters.

# EX3
Write a program that reads the coefficients a, b, c, d, e, f of a linear system of two equations with two variables and shows the solution.

- 𝑎𝑥+𝑏𝑦=𝑒
- 𝑐𝑥+𝑑𝑦=𝑓

# EX4
Write and run a program that simulates a simple calculator. It must reads two integers and one character and...
- Print the sum if the "+" is inserted
- Print the difference if the "-" is inserted
- Print the product if the "*" is inserted
- Print the quotient if the "/" is inserted
- Print the rest if the "%" is inserted

# EX5
Write a program that asks for a non-negative value "n", let's say 6, and displays the following output:

1?2?3?4?5?6
1?2?3?4?5
1?2?3?4
1?2?3
1?2
1

### EX6
Write a function that reads a sequence of 10 numbers in a certain order and then displays them in direct and reverse order (without using shortcuts).

### EX7

### EX8

### EX9

### EX10

### EX11

### EX12
Write a function that gives a set of students and grades associated with them and then returns a dictionary of the students and the votes associated with them, divided by letter of the surname. The keys are the groups (a-f), (g-o), (p-z), the values are student lists and grades.

- Define the function of inserting and deleting a given student in the dictionary just created.

- Define the function that you insert to a student in the dictionary one list of votes.

### EX13
